 Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

 ## Aim

 We aim to streamline the itinerary planning process and make it an enjoyable process for users.

 ## Motivation

 Currently, itinerary planning is done on word docs or excel sheets. While they have their benefits, both are inefficient for itinerary planning. 
 Firstly, it is difficult to see the timings of the itinerary on the two platforms. 
 Next, people are also needed to manually fill in their planned activities. 
 Lastly, people have to constantly read up on activities through different tabs. Hence, planning for a trip using such platforms is a very tedious process. 
 Although there are services out there that offer itinerary planning UIs, these services are premium only. Our service will be free (subject to advertisements) while providing a competitive planning experience. 
 We also aim to provide a platform where people can share the itineraries created on our site. Travellers who do not have the time are able to access one easily, without having to go through the trouble of planning one themselves or visiting multiple different websites.
